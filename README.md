# node-addon-api issue 1584

This is a repro to create a possible workaroud to solve the issue [1584](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api/issues/1584)

In this repo I'm using the package `node-api-headers` to include the last Node-API headers and to avoid that the headers depends on a specific version of Node.js.
